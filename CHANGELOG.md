# Changelog

## v1.0.0

### Added
- New CRD `CloudflareTunnelRule` — primitive for cloudflared ingress rules, emitted by source controllers or hand-authored.
- `CloudflareTunnel.spec.connector` — operator-managed cloudflared Deployment + ConfigMap + ServiceAccount.
- `CloudflareTunnel.spec.routing.defaultBackend` — tunnel-wide default backend routing.
- New source controllers:
  - `httproute_source` — watches Gateway API `HTTPRoute` + `Gateway`, emits DNS from `cloudflare.io/*` annotations.
  - `service_source` — watches `Service`, emits DNS + TunnelRule from `cloudflare.io/*` annotations.
- External-dns-compatible plaintext TXT ownership registry in `internal/cloudflare/txt_registry.go` for record adoption and conflict detection during migration.
- New operator config: `TXT_OWNER_ID` (required to activate sources), `TXT_IMPORT_OWNERS`, `TXT_PREFIX`, `TXT_SUFFIX`, `TXT_WILDCARD_REPLACEMENT`.

### Changed
- RBAC cluster role now includes cluster-wide write on `deployments`/`configmaps`/`serviceaccounts` (needed because tunnel CRs can live in any namespace). Scoped in practice by ownerRef to `CloudflareTunnel`.
- Operator image requires `sigs.k8s.io/gateway-api` CRDs installed in the cluster.

### Migration
- v0.5.x → v1.0.0 is a pure add. Without `TXT_OWNER_ID` set, annotation-driven sources are inert and existing behavior is unchanged.
- To activate: install Gateway API CRDs → set `TXT_OWNER_ID` → annotate workloads. See [docs/external-dns-migration.md](docs/external-dns-migration.md) for drop-in paths from external-dns.
